                <p>Agents of Shield is an American television series created for ABC by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Maurissa Tancharoen. The show was based on the Marvel Comics organizatin S.H.I.E.L.D.. It is often argued whether or not its is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though in the early seasons since it acknowledges the continuity of the franchise's films and other television seasons, one can assume that it was originally set there and eventually breaks away from it. The series was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions, and sees Clark Gregg reprise his role as Phil Coulson from the film series. During the course of the show, 136 episodes of Agents of Shield aired over the Seven Seasons, between September 24th, 2013, and Auguest 12th, 2020.It was such a big hit within the Marvel fandom with the first episode gaining 12.12 million viewers in just the US alone.</p>
