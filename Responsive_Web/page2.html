                    Later in the series, the team introduces new technology, such as the Framework, a virtual reality program that allows the user to enter a digital world. The Framework was created by Dr. Holden Radcliffe, a former Shield scientist who was working with the villainous organization Hydra. The Framework was used by Hydra to create a digital world where they could control the actions and thoughts of individuals.

The Zephyr One is equipped with advanced cloaking technology and various other state-of-the-art systems.
