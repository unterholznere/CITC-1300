        <h1>Agents of Shield</H1>
      <hr>
        <p>Agents of Shield is Marvel's 2013 show that originally aired on ABC. It was set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring agents of the spy organization in this world of superheroes. With actors from previous films repirsing their roles, such as Clark Gregg starring as Phillip J. Coulson. And new characters being introduced to the MCU such as Daisy Johnson (played by Chloe Bennet), Jemma Simmons (by Elizabeth Henstridge), and Leopold Fitz (by Iain De Caestecker). In this show they are "the line between the world and the much weirder world." Meaning they protect people from superatural occurrences including, superhuman soilders and alien virus that kills people in a very unusal way.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        
        <p>Marvel Agents of Shield's focuses on Phil Coulson's hand-picked team facing all sorts of obsticals. This hand-picked group includes all the stereotypes for a secret agent team from genius scientists, skillful field agents, to a hacker asset. Phil Coulson, trained by Director Fury, is the leader of this team, ultimately making all the tough calls on missons. Then there is Melinda May, famously known as the Cavlery, who is Coulson's right hand woman. She orignially joined the team as just a pilot, but stepped out of her comfort zone to be in the field again. Next, we have Grant Ward, a very serious field agent, who doesn't want to be on the plane as he typically works alone. Then we have the iconic duo, Jemma Simmons and Leopold Fitz, the scientists on the team. Simmons is the biochemist, who is one of the youngest members of SHIELD's research division. Fitz is the engineer of the team, as well as one of the youngest members of SHIELD's Sci-Tech division. And finally we have Skye, who will later be known as Daisy Johnson, who is the hacker that gets recruited to the team as a consultant, before she soon becomes a offical agent after showing her loyalty. Though as the seasons go on new characters are introduced and old chaaracters leave.</p>
